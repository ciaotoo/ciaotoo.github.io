      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>As the amount of workers being moved towards remote workdays has sharply increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
        it has become much easier for workers to fall into isolation as more difficulties arise regarding how workers
        interact during the workday.

      <h3>Struggling to Adapt</h3>
      <p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of knowledge workers across North America have struggled to move their work lives
         online. Although teleconferencing, email, and other internet tools have allowed teams to stay connected, we discovered that
         employees are feeling more disconnected than ever. <span class="dark_highlight">How might we improve remote interpersonal
         connection by recreating the way workers interacted in the office?</span></p>

      <h3>How are People Communicating?</h3>
      <p>Many companies have had to find new ways for workers to communicate, and using platforms tested before
         the pandemic has been the quickest solution. This spares the time required to find and introduce new platforms to a company's
         workflow.</p>
      <p>However, as usage of these platforms increase, the amount of users that say video calls help them feel connected has
         plummeted. <span class="dark_highlight">95.1% of our survey respondents (87 participants) mentioned it was difficult getting to know
         coworkers remotely,</span> with awkwardness, inconvenience, and availability confusions being listed as main reasons.</p>

      <h3>A New Way to Interact</h3>
      <p>Wörkestra is a desktop and mobile app that allows remote coworkers to see and hear each other’s keyboard and mouse clicks. We want
         to discover how teams can be more present with each other over given their removal from the office.
         Wörkestra aims to help reduce workplace isolation by <span class="dark_highlight">creating a more informal and delightful way for
         teams to connect throughout the workday.</span></p>

      <h3>A Minimal Presence</h3>
      <p>Wörkestra can be used in its minimized form on the current or separate monitor for workers to see what their coworkers are
        up to. The goal is for this application to <span class="dark_highlight">display within the worker's peripherals to support meaningful interaction while not
        distracting them from their work.</span>

      <h3>A Personalized Experience</h3>
      <p>With limited customization options available in platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, and Slack,
        we wanted to emphasize the importance of self expression, especially within the remote workplace. These instruments act as an
        <span class="dark_highlight">extension of one's personality, which is especially beneficial when workers may not have even met their coworkers in person.</span>

      <h3>A Series of Keywords</h3>
      <p>When working away at pushing changse to Github, grabbing an elote for lunch, or just about anything elseW
        Wörkestra will push an associated emoji to typed words onto the UI to let others know what you may be up to.
       </p>
       <p>This is a unique opportunity for coworkers to better know when you may be available in a casual manner, allowing for better
         scheduling of work/non-work related events or tasks, such as taking a lunch break over Google meet, or setting up a daily standup.

      <h3>Reimagining the Watercooler</h3>
      <p><span class="dark_highlight">We made a way for coworkers to build social support, create opportunities for collaboration, and establish a sense of community
        at a distance—similar to short watercooler chats in the office.</span> These moments foster respect and familiarity within teams and
        across departments, allowing colleagues to better seek information, opinions, and guidance in ways that are spontaneous
        and personable.
       </p>
       <p>With these conversations comes better feedback across the team and company, a healthier and more productive work environment,
         and more successful collaboration over time.

      <h3>There Must Be a Conductor!</h3>
      <p>Team leads can take charge of day-to-day work pacing by adjusting the tempo throughout the day to fit the type of work
        being done, all while active productivity. Doing a team sprint over the next few hours? Crank up the tempo! When workers play back the sounds at the end
        of the workday, they can hear how changes in their daily workflow are translated into music.

      <h3>North Stars</h3>
      <p>As we pivoted to focus on the emotional aspects of human connection, we created two primary guiding principles through
         our research to ground our product, which emphasizes creating a pleasant work environment.</p>
      <p>We wanted to incorporate our human senses and prioritized the often overlooked properties of sound as
         an equal to our product's visuals. With the right balance of sound and visual design, we were better
         positioned to make an application that doesn't disrupt someone's daily workflow, but enhances it.

      <h3>The New Employee</h3>
      <p>We consolidated the nuances of our data to create rich and inclusive archetypes. Do subjects have a separate and private working
         space or live alone? Are they financially equipped to sustain long-term remote work? Do they have access to reliable technology
         to accomplish their tasks? It’s important to consider environmental and dynamic social circumstances to <span class="dark_highlight">understand
         how inequality presents itself in remote work.</span></p>
      <p>As our key measure for this project was to bring joy and support remote workers, we constructed our persona around a recent hire
         during COVID-19 with no prior experience in the workplace. Despite scheduling frequent 1:1s with her lead and coworkers, she finds
         it difficult to establish strong emotional connections with her coworkers. Being her first remote role, her fears are
         misinterpretations, unrealistic expectations, and working within a competitive junior culture.</p>

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">Thank You for Reading:</span> My Takeaways</h3>
      <p>After reaching out to three of my closest friends since our first project together in first year, we shared the same
        feeling: COVID isolation is rough. I didn't leave my neighborhood for six months since the start of the pandemic. It felt
        right to meet (virtually) and put together this project aiming to reclaim the feelings we get when we're physically together.
      </p>
      <p>Remote work was a new experience for all of us. With help from a professor (now dean (congrats Carman!)), we
        navigated through failing wifi signals, broken calls, and an assortment of other issues to make a project we're
        all proud of.
