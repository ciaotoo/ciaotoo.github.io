      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">Context:</span> My Role at Safe</h3>
      <p>Safe Software created FME, a digital integration platform with the best support for spatial data. I worked on the Digital
        Marketing and User Experience teams.
      </p>
        <p>Being part of a growing design team, I've been able to hold a key role in conceptualizing and deciding on what integral
           components are fundamental in the operations of Safe's interconnected design teams. Given the scale of this project, I was
           proud of how we managed to significantly improve collaboration between design and the other disciplines while I was there.

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">Problem:</span> Lack of Centralization</h3>
      <p>With a growing design team holding key roles in cross-platform products, I became increasingly aware of our disconnected
         structures. Safe had an existing UI kit but problems frequently came up around how or where to use something, or why
         we had several instances of it. The kit resulted in a low ROI, longer times to market, and many frustrations across
         designers and devs.
       </p>
        <p>I successfully advocated for the creation of a design system with reliable documentaion, working code and design resources, and human
           interface guidelines to build consistent experiences at scale.

      <h3>Design System Values</h3>
      <p>With an evolving product strategy and visual language—our methods had to change too. I dove head first into defining a
        bespoke solution for our long-term needs.
       </p>
      <p>Given my temporary position, I ensured this system was outcome driven; emphasizing a long-term solution that is reliable and
         adaptable. I defined a set of values to ensure we deliver flexibility, consistency, and quality to all our end users.

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">Need:</span> Reducing Technical Debt</h3>
      <p>With my lead, I logged every component and layout used throughout our core internal and external products. Any skepticism
         towards the need of a design system was wiped when I visualized the technical debt across our product. With dozens of iterations
         of a single component, misued type weights, and one-off layouts among other issues, the lack of structure was obvious.
       </p>
        <p>After multiple rounds of review, I compiled fundamental components onto a Figma page to begin documentation for our
           pattern library. Working closely with our developers, I ensured that each component page has an specific name,
           description of its parts and use, code chunks, and a changelog.

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">Audience:</span> Who I Designed For</h3>
      <p>With multiple design and development team across four products that each handle their front and back-end work differently, I
        facilitated numerous discussions to ensure our outcome was immediately usable and flexible enough for future iteration through
        the development pipeline.
       </p>
      <p>We needed structure that would scale with the company's growth while being accessible, sustainable, and
        collaborative to work for the multiple platforms and use cases. Backed by thorough documentation, I designed and helped build
        components with consistent naming conventions, layer structures, styling, and more.

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">Designing</span> At Scale</h3>
      <p>Because we had an existing UI Kit, a major concern gathered from team members was the speed of how we’d approach transforming
        our platforms. Through more calls with devs. and team leads, I determined that although 100%
        change is unattainable; many 1% changes through marginal gains is much more feasible and sustainable.
       </p>
        <p>I applied developer feedback and made sure components are thoroughly documented
          with usage guidelines, code snippets, and more beneficial content to address growth. This guarantees fast learning while
          ensuring everyone has a voice no matter how large a team, or this system gets.
          <!-- and how to make When I thought we were 4-5 people,
          I was 20% of the output of our team. What happens when our team grows? How can I make sure everyone still has a voice -->

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">The</span> Results</h3>
      <p>Designing components had its own share of difficulties. From making sure
         every layer met strict naming standards, to recognizing to what the extent I can push our visual style, it was incredibly
         rewarding to use, and see others make use of our new components. The work done with our design system had also
         prompted developers to look into a new css framework, Tailwind, which will inevitably be used to structure our pattern
         library on the front end.

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">Takeaways:</span> An Ongoing Process</h3>
      <p>This project allowed me to practice systems thinking, regularly managing collaboration with developers, and human-centered
        design thinking to consider all the required features of what has become a widely used resource. I explored opportunities
        to experiment with unique patterns and interactions while exploring undefined use-cases that were not initially captured in
        my project’s brief.
       </p>
       <p>I’m proud to have delivered a comprehensive product that is living, and ever-changing, with the ability to be further adapted
         and localized for use across specific products in Safe’s lineup. This experience helped me become proactive in leading
         conversations, determining what to pull from large amounts of feedback, updating stakeholders, and selling an idea based
         on gathered data. It is incredibly rewarding to know that my internship project is actively used and modified by the growing
         design team at Safe.
