      <p>The digital touchpoints to Studio Ghibli are scattered across multiple third-party sites, many of which are only offered
         in Japanese. This frustrates consumers when trying to find reliable content direct from the studio—leaving the consumer

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">Strategy:</span> The Studio Ghibli Brand</h3>
      <p>When leading strategy and UX research for this project, it as determined we should unpack Studio Ghibli’s brand pillars
         as a means to understand their market positioning and how they provide unique value for varying consumers. We’ve identified three
         main pillars of: Purpose, perception, and position.</p>

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">Strategy:</span> Narrowing Our Scope</h3>
      <p>Our aspirations for this project were lofty and unrealistic. We followed assumptions which brought us into creating band-aid solutions.
         I refined our scope to address two primary business and consumer needs defined from earlier rounds of primary and secondary research. These
         require minimal invesetment while ensuring meaningful long-term engagement.

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">Intervention:</span> Extending the Journey</h3>
      <p>Following a series of interview with Ghibli fans, I found that many retain strong connections to the brand regardless of when they interacted with it, if at all.
         This continued appreciation of Studio Ghibli is where I proposed we intervene. We want to tap into the relationship that existing customers have with the
         studio to reignite their interest in Ghibli’s collection of work through further immersion into the brand and its products.

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">Result:</span> A Logical and Immersive Landing</h3>
      <p>Upon landing, we offer key information optimized for both new and returning fans—guiding them towards their unique goals.
         Visitors are brought into Ghibli's cinematic atmosphere while being given options to discover exhibitions or
         studio workspaces, or learn more about their favourite films.
      </p>
      <p>The strict amount of possible actions removes cognitive overhead by streamlining the user flow.

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">Result:</span> Exhibition and Studio Spaces</h3>
      <p>From the landing page, we offer the chance to experience exhibitions and actual Ghibli workspaces which were previously
        exclusive to the physical Ghibli studios/museum/theme park in Japan. Using the iconic Soot Ball characters to afford for
        interactions, we can guide visitors through the spaces, highlighting objects that inspired aspects of a film.

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">Result:</span> Dedicated Movie Pages</h3>
      <p>Interviews pointed to a desire for content relating to a film’s production, such as sketches and concept art. This valuable
        content previously kept from viewers creates a desire to revisit the site in the future. Fans can also discover more about
         films they previously watched—inspiring new ways to rewatch an old favourite.

         Fans can also buy licensed merchandise here, which was almost impossible to do in the past.

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">UX:</span> Intended User Flow</h3>
      <p>One major issue was managing the abundance of Studio Ghibli material. I proposed a shallow site hierarchy for ease of
         navigation while suggesting we split into two streams of content for new(er) and returning visitors—exhibitions and films.
      </p>
      <p>
         One stream connects viewers to previously inaccessible studio and exhibition spaces while the the other goes direct into Studio Ghibli's
         large catalogue of films. The experience is all tied together with delightful interactions and animations to support one's navigation through the site.

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">Intervention:</span> Key Entry Points</h3>
      <p>Existing fans lack engagement with Studio Ghibli beyond their initial interaction with films, or other products. Scattered primary
         and third-party touchpoints drive a wedge between the business and fans, leading to decreased revenue and an unfavorable perception
         of brand. <span class="dark_highlight">How might we improve emotional interpersonal connection by creating a way

      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">Thank You for Reading:</span> My Takeaways</h3>
      <p>Creating a highly polished experience design project with some of my best friends for one of our favourite companies was incredibly
        rewarding. Whether through Studio Ghibli-inspired lofi or poorly made memes (which I'll keep hidden..); we worked through countless
        hours without ever feeling tired.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our passion for this project as long-time Ghibli fans (I watched my first
        ever Ghibli film after this project even though I've been to their museum in Japan) permeated every inch of our work. We learned to
        trust our guts, refer to primary and secondary research religiously, and be okay with making sudden large changes to make a better product.
