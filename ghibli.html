      <h3><span class="dark_highlight">The Problem:</span> Struggling to Adapt</h3>
      <p>Existing fans lack engagement with Studio Ghibli beyond their initial interaction with films, or other products. Scattered primary
         and third-party touchpoints drive a wedge between the business and fans, leading to decreased revenue and an unfavorable perception
         of brand. <span class="dark_highlight">How might we improve emotional interpersonal connection by creating a way
         for workers to communicate in a wordless medium?</span></p>

      <h3>A New Way to Interact</h3>
      <p>Wörkestra is a desktop and mobile app that allows remote coworkers to see and hear each other’s keyboard and mouse clicks. With
         teams distanced by a technological barrier, we want to discover how teams can be more present with each other over that distance.
         Wörkestra aims to help reduce workplace isolation by <span class="dark_highlight">creating a more informal and joyful way for teams to connect
         throughout the workday.</span></p>

      <h3>How are People Communicating?</h3>
      <p>Many companies have had to find new ways for workers to communicate with one another. For many, using platforms utilized before
         the pandemic has been the quickest solution, as it spares the time required to find and introduce new platforms to a company's
         workflow.</p>
      <p>However, as usage of these platforms increase, the amount of users that say video calls help them feel truly connected has
         plummeted. In addition, <span class="dark_highlight">95.1% of survey respondents mentioned it was difficult getting to know
         coworkers remotely, with awkwardness, inconvenience, and confusion about availability being listed as the main reasons.</span></p>

      <h3>North Stars</h3>
      <p>As we pivoted to focus primarily on the emotional aspects of human connection, we derived two primary guiding principles through
         our research as way to stay grounded as a product which emphasizes curating a pleasant work environment.</p>
      <p>While seeking to leverage the five human senses, we aimed to prioritize the often overlooked properties of sound, as pair it as
         an equal to the visuals in the product's interface. With the right balance of both sound and visual design, we were better
         positioned to create an application which does not disrupt one's daily workflow, but enhances it.</p>

      <h3>The New Employee</h3>
      <p>We needed to explore the nuances of our data to create rich and inclusive personas. Do they have a separate and private working
         space or live alone? Are they financially equipped to sustain long-term remote work? Do they have access to reliable technology
         to accomplish their tasks? It’s important to consider these environmental and social perspectives and challenges to understand
         how inequality presents itself in remote work.</p>
      <p>As our key measure for this project was to bring joy and support remote workers, we constructed our persona around a recent hire
         during COVID-19 with no prior experience in the workplace. Despite scheduling frequent 1:1s with her lead and coworkers, she finds
         it difficult to establish strong emotional connections with her coworkers. Being her first remote role, her fears are
         misinterpretations, unrealistic expectations, and working within a competitive junior culture.</p>
