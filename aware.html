    <h6>Context</h6>
    <p class="about_text text_content">This project came as the product of a conversation I had with a friend visiting the USA and Canada from Fukuoka, Japan.</p>
    <p class="about_text text_content">Coming from a safe country where she doesn't need to have a guard up in public, her immediate feelings about the cities she visited in North America were public anxiety and unease. She could safely walk around through dimly lit alleys back in Japan, but even if surrounded by peers here, she had a heightened sense of anxiety.</p>

  <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p class="text_content">Vancouver is a constantly growing city that sees an estimated 1.3% annual population increase, coupled with a .8% - 1.2% annual increase in violent crimes. With an increasing student population fueled by Vancouver's reputation as a melting pot of global cultures, there is growing concern for student safety both on and off campus as 19-27% of women and 6-8% of men in post-secondary education will experience unwanted sexual violence.</p>
    <figure>
      <img class="image_space" src="images/aware/1.png" alt="Big Ass Image">
    </figure>
    <p class="caption image_space" >A surprising amount of respondents were unaware of available resources. This led to the common perception in interviews that if assistance for the problem isn't well advertised, it's not a problem worth worrying about.</p>

  <h3>An Opportunity For Change</h3>
    <p class="text_content">After pulling research insights through affinity mapping, I narrowed my focus to creating an immediate and plausible long-term change. Through extensive interviewing throughout the lower mainland and remote platforms, over 60% of respondents were unaware of existing digital resources, and would support the idea of an independant resource database.</p>
    <p class="text_content">The idea of having this information coupled with a report feature resulted in greater trust compared to searching the internet for sites such as Options for Sexual Health or having to download multiple ineffective applications catered to both awareness and immediate aid. Aware also offers unbiased and non-politically-charged typically found in government and agency-backed platforms</p>
    <figure>
      <img class="image_space" src="images/aware/2.png" alt="Big Ass Image">
    </figure>
    <p class="caption image_space" >72% of interviewees noted that an independant resource platform would provide subconscious comfort in public and appears more secure than a government-backed digital ecosystem.</p>

  <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
    <p class="text_content">To avoid going off the assignment path and risk creating false constraints or new ideas, I established a set of guiding principles that would inform all future decisions, and to ensure I had a set of rules to further ground my work on.</p>
    <figure>
      <img class="image_space" src="images/aware/3.png" alt="Big Ass Image">
    </figure>

  <h3>Identifying the Primary Audience</h3>
  <p class="text_content">After conducting interviews with both domestic and foreign students from various universities, I constructed two main personas. To narrow focus for the remainder of deliverables, the Cautious Observer, a reserved international student, was chosen as a representation of my international friend, and to represent the depth of individuals that this type of violence can affect.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="images/aware/4.png" alt="Big Ass Image">
    </figure>
    <p class="caption image_space" >Respondents saw the practical use of Aware as a passive application on their device, accessible whenever needed. Compared to competitors such as Navy Domestic Violence Prevention, a government-created resource for domestic violence in the Navy, Aware would not be a short-term intervention with single use followed by immediate drop-off.</p>

  <h3>Unconditional Fulfillment and Value</h3>
    <p class="text_content">Informed by the persona and the insights gained through their frictions, I established product brand values to cater to a wide variety of potential customers affected by violence. These values helped shape the form of the UI in addition to understanding the product's success and effectiveness in my community.</p>
    <figure>
      <img class="image_space" src="images/aware/5.png" alt="Big Ass Image">
    </figure>

  <h3>Centralized Access</h3>
    <p class="text_content">The dashboard allows immediate access to the most relevant information defined at the research stage. This exploration was chosen over others as it provides immediate actions and an emphasis on retention. Based off the first round of testing, the first exploration resulted in an abundance of potential UI changes from the ability to add and remove custom panels. Features deemed unnecessary were removed as they strayed too far from the original problem.</p>
    <figure>
      <img class="image_space" src="images/aware/6.png" alt="Big Ass Image">
    </figure>

  <h3>Connect and Learn</h3>
    <p class="text_content">By leveraging patterns in existing online-based information hubs, I maintained a simlar structure that potential users may expect when opening up Aware for the first time. This allows those not making a report or finding assistance, to access Aware as a database with content written by community members, which strives for a stronger connection than resources pulled from a government-backed site.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="images/aware/7.png" alt="Big Ass Image">
    </figure>

  <h3>Miltulingual Interface</h3>
    <p class="text_content">From 10 interviewees, 8 spoke multiple languages, and 4 noted that English was their second language. With a growing population of first-generation Canadians that lack confidence in their English comprehension, it was important to understand how their cultural influence and differences would inform design decisions.</p>
    <p class="text_content">This platform will be available in multiple languages to prevent individuals being forced into unwanted situations due to language barriers, as well as making the customer feel cared for in a potentially new country with different social norms.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="images/aware/9.png" alt="Big Ass Image">
    </figure>

  <h3>A Compassionate Tone</h3>
    <p class="text_content">After a round of testing with students at both Simon Fraser University (3) and Kwantlen Polytechnic (2), a frequent comment was the feeling of being interrogated and that the conversation-based interface appeared overly mechanic.</p>
    <p class="text_content image_space">Through adjusting copy towards a serious/genuine tone, the same respondents had felt more compelled to provide detailed accounts of, albeit made-up, user-stories. The incorporation of my communication background aided in the production of copy that met product needs and propelled customer enjoyment</p>

  <h3>Reflections</h3>
    <p class="list_item">Too much time was spent optimizing for speed. More time could have been put into early process in order to benefit greater long-term confidence in the project and final product. Despite all of the research that amounted to the physical product, I found more opportunities to configure a final product with the output of more wireframes and low-mid fidelity prototypes. The information gathered through interviews and testing resulted in a better understanding of both the overall project context and how to proceed with final mockups. However, there are still a few concerns that I may potentially tackle in the future:</p>
    <p class="list_item">• What if the customer doesn't feel safe reporting to the police?</p>
    <p class="list_item">• Would the customer feel more secure knowing that actions were taken against their perpetrator?</p>
    <p class="list_item">• How would our end know if someone is making a legitimate report?</p>
    <p class="list_item">• How would I enable customer-made content for empathetic stories based on actual experience?</p>
