        <p>
          Upon being tasked with creating mockups for a new feature, <span class="dark_highlight">I quickly encountered a common issue:
          The lack of reliable assets and guidelines.</span> Instead, I was often directed to sift through numerous shared files or
          create my own components from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite having prior experience working with design systems, I refrained from immediately proposing one. I wanted to fully
          understand our team, or corporation's underlying problems, whether they stemmed from a missing component library or potential
          software limitations, to ensure any solution I proposed would address the root causes.

        <p>
          To understand the core issues faced by designers, developers, and product managers—such as handoff inefficiencies and
          time-to-market pressures—I conducted both qualitative and quantitative research with support from our research team.
        </p>
        <p>
          We gathered 31 survey responses and held 12 in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, including designers, developers,
          and UX writers. These discussions helped us pinpoint the critical pain points and needs, allowing us to better shape our
          approach to improving the design process.

      <hr class="dash">
        <p>Designers struggled with inconsistency due to duplicate components and the absence of reliable guidelines.
          Many, including myself, resorted to creating bespoke components, which led to wasted time, confusion, and an
          inflated asset library. Additionally, they frequently made uncertain decisions about styling and placement without
          clear direction, further complicating their work.
        </p>
        <p>For developers, the lack of clear instructions caused them to make assumptions during implementation, resulting
          in product inconsistencies and more work for designers. Many were unaware of existing components, leading to redundant
          work and increased development time. Managing and updating custom components was also error-prone, contributing to
          technical debt and maintenance challenges.

        I identified designers and developers as the primary users to focus on, as they are responsible for creating and
        implementing features. By providing them with a comprehensive asset sheet and clear guidelines, we could ensure
        consistency in both component function and style across the platform. This approach would also streamline access
        to assets within design and development tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        My assumption was that addressing these issues at the organizational level would lead to a more cohesive and intuitive
        user experience, ultimately reducing experience gaps and improving overall product satisfaction.

      <hr class="dash">
      <p>After reviewing the findings with my mentor, we identified three main pain points. First, disjointed experiences across
        services arose from a lack of standardization, forcing designers and developers to make individual style decisions,
        which led to inconsistencies and undermined brand confidence.
      </p>
      <p>Second, redundant assets and classes cluttered our files, making it difficult to find components in Figma or code,
        increasing both design and technical debt, and leading to excessive rework due to misalignment.
      </p>
      <p>Third, Finally, accessibility needs were overlooked, particularly for users with cognitive disabilities or those using
        assistive technologies. This impacted usability across the product and needed urgent attention to ensure all features
        were built with accessibility in mind.

      <p>
        I began by building the foundational elements of the design system, such as colors and typography, to bring structure
        to our previously unorganized styles. Prioritizing scalability and efficiency, I leveraged Figma’s advanced features,
        such as variables and dev-mode, while collaborating with a front-end lead to ensure technical feasibility. This also
        addressed the development team’s need for inclusion throughout the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        After auditing common styles, we established a clear set with descriptions of when to use them. This approach not only
        laid the groundwork for component development but also demonstrated immediate value to stakeholders and strengthened
        communication with developers, who had previously felt disconnected from the process.

        When developing components, I focused on meeting the needs of both designers and developers to ensure a seamless user
        experience. Based on the findings from our qualitative and quantitative research, I addressed key pain points like
        inconsistent design, inefficient workflows, and communication gaps. This helped guide the design of flexible,
        accessible components that could be easily modified and adapted across projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each component was designed with scalability in mind, featuring pre-defined content and clear guidelines to ensure
        ease of use. This approach not only promoted consistency but also enhanced collaboration between teams, reducing
        rework and improving time to market. By aligning the components with the specific needs of our users—derived from
        research—I ensured the design system provided practical solutions, contributing to a more efficient and user-centered workflow.

      <h3>(12) <span class="dark_highlight">Key Outcomes</span></h3>
      <hr class="dash">
      <p>
        Since implementing the design system, we’ve seen a 30% reduction in components by eliminating redundancies and simplifying
        our design structure. This was tracked through the initial audit and led to faster implementation times for features
        prioritized by PMs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another key result is the improvement in time to implementation, as teams can now move more quickly from the moment a
        PM prioritizes a feature. By cutting design and development overhead, we've freed up time for designers and developers
        to focus on crafting user experiences rather than spending it searching for or recreating assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Figma’s metrics have also shown a strong adoption rate across teams, which highlights the cross-functional collaboration
        fostered by the design system. This level of adoption supports our broader goals of scalability and consistency across
        the Knox console. Each of these outcomes is tied back to the KPIs we set, ensuring that the system is addressing core
        issues such as inefficiency, inconsistency, and communication breakdowns, all while contributing to improved overall productivity.

      <p>
        One of my key learnings is that work doesn’t end once a design system goes live; it's crucial to continuously monitor data
        and feedback to keep things stable and effective. I realized that making small, frequent improvements based on actual
        needs can have a greater impact at scale without disrupting workflows. Lastly, I’ve gained a deeper appreciation for the
        importance of continuous learning and knowledge sharing to ensure consistency and keep teams engaged throughout the process.
